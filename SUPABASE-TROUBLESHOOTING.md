# Supabase Connection Troubleshooting

## Issue Found
Your Supabase project (`smzamnifaboqkjulrtqj`) is active and reachable, but the database hostname `db.smzamnifaboqkjulrtqj.supabase.co` is not resolving.

## How to Get the Correct Connection String

1. **Go to your Supabase Dashboard**: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. **Select your project**: `smzamnifaboqkjulrtqj`
3. **Navigate to**: Settings → Database
4. **Find "Connection string"** section
5. **Select "URI"** tab (not "Pooler" or others)
6. **Copy the exact connection string**

## Expected Format
```
postgresql://postgres:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@db.[PROJECT-REF].supabase.co:5432/postgres
```

## Common Issues

### 1. Wrong Connection String Format
- Make sure you're using the **URI** format, not individual components
- Don't use the **Pooler** connection string for migrations

### 2. Database Not Ready
- New Supabase projects take a few minutes to fully initialize
- Try waiting 5-10 minutes after project creation

### 3. Firewall/Network Issues
- Some corporate networks block database connections
- Try from a different network or use VPN

## Alternative: Supabase Connection Pooling

If direct connection fails, try the pooler connection:
1. In Supabase Dashboard → Settings → Database
2. Look for **"Connection Pooler"** section
3. Use **"Transaction"** mode for migrations
4. Use **"Session"** mode for application connections

## Quick Test

Once you have the correct connection string:

```bash
node verify-supabase.js
node test-connection.js
```

## Temporary Solution

I can set up the system to work locally first, then switch to Supabase once the connection is fixed:

1. Install PostgreSQL locally, OR
2. Use a different cloud database service, OR  
3. Use Docker PostgreSQL container

Would you like me to proceed with any of these options?
